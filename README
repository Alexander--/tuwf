TUWF - The Ultimate Website Framework


  This package provides the following set of modules:

    TUWF
    TUWF::DB
    TUWF::XML
    TUWF::Misc
    TUWF::Request
    TUWF::Response


  Optional dependencies:
    (Perl core modules not listed)

    DBI              for SQL functionality (TUWF::DB)
    FCGI             to run in a FastCGI environment
    PerlIO::gzip     output compression


  Notes on usage

    The API of this module is in flux, and I am not one to care much about
    backwards compatibility. If you decide to use TUWF, either get one version
    and stick to that, or be sure to read all commit messages if you want to
    stay up-to-date.
